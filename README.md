# Reaction Tester Game
This project is based on a javascript tutorial provided by Mr. Rob Percival. 
Mr. Percival challenged students to be creative and make changes to the initial game.
Inspired by the challenge, I have implemented a small number of new features. 
In my version:
1) The level of difficulty increases after 20 clicks (the shapes appear at a faster interval).
2) The level of difficulty increases again after 30 clicks (the shapes are smaller).
3) The game calculates the user's average reaction time
4) I've implemented a "reset" button (initially hidden).
