# Reaction Tester Game
This project is based on a javascript tutorial provided by Mr. Rob Percival. 
Mr. Percival challenged students to be creative and make changes to the initial game.
Inspired by the challenge, I have implemented a small number of new features. 
In my version:

1) I've incorporated music that plays the duration of the game.
2) There is a "beep" sound whe shapes are clicked.
3) I've implemented a scoring system (the faster a player clicks a shape, the greater number of points she receives).
4) I've supplied the player with a "dark mode" option.
5) I've refactored the code from procedural to object oriented.
