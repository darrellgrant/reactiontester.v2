          This project is based on a javascript tutorial provided by Mr. Rob
          Percival. Mr. Percival challenged students to be creative and make
          changes to the initial game. Inspired by the challenge, I have
          implemented a small number of new features.
        </p>

        In my version:

        <ul>
          <li>I've incorporated music that plays the duration of the game.</li>
          <li>There is a "beep" sound whe shapes are clicked.</li>
          <li>
            I've implemented a scoring system (the faster a player clicks a
            shape, the greater number of points she receives)
          </li>
          <li>I've supplied the player with a "dark mode" option.</li>
          <li>I've refactored the code from procedural to object oriented.</li>
        </ul>
